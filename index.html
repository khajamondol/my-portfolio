            <p>Hello there! Before talking about qualification and professional abilities. I would like to introduce myself. I am Md. Shafiqul and I am from Rangur Bangladesh. Talking web development as a rpofession nto only fulfils my pocket but also my heart because it has been my fassion since my early teenage. I velive that people should do things in which they are good at or in which their heart lays. That's why I chose freelance web development as my career because velive I'm good at this and mas I am alays honest and I am never afraid of doing hard work</p>
